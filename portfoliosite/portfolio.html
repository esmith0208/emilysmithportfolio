            <p><strong>Project Scope:</strong> For my Intermediate Interaction Design class, I developed this project as
              a template for future work to easily upload and showcase media.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Delivered:</strong> The design process involved transforming initial wireframes and
              sketches
              into a functional, responsive site. I focused on creating a clean, structured layout that could be
              adaptable for different types of projects.
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> Throughout the development, I applied interaction design principles to
              ensure an intuitive user experience while balancing aesthetic elements for a polished look. This project
              solidified my understanding of turning design concepts into a tangible website, while enhancing my skills
              in wireframing and iterative prototyping.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Scope:</strong> For my Generative AI class, the goal of our final project was to explore
              how AI and human collaboration could be leveraged to combat a world issue. My teammates and I chose to
              focus on the topic of misinformation, and specifically social media's role in its spread.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Delivered:</strong> We began by conducting in-depth research on misinformation, analyzing
              how it affects different groups, especially younger audiences and older adults. Using tools like SWOT
              analysis and generative AI, we dissected the causes and consequences of misinformation. Our solutions
              centered around two possible futures: one where AI flags misleading content for human review, and another
              where users crowdsource fact-checking. In both cases, we aimed to empower users while restoring
              credibility and trust in social media.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> The design process included ideation using generative AI, as well as
              prototyping potential systems that could make these futures a reality. Throughout the project, we applied
              a creative, research-driven approach to define the problem, analyze potential impacts, and develop
              solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Scope:</strong> For my Introduction to Interaction Design class, I had the opportunity to
              create this recipe site, marking one of my first hands-on experiences with HTML, CSS, and basic
              JavaScript.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Delivered:</strong> Throughout the process, I learned how to structure a webpage, design
              it with CSS for visual appeal, and add functionality using JavaScript. This project helped me understand
              the core principles of web development and interaction design, as I transformed basic concepts into a
              fully functioning website.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> This project deepened my technical skills in web development,
              particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also sparked a greater interest in creating visually
              engaging and user-friendly web designs, reinforcing my understanding of how design choices can enhance
              user experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Scope:</strong> In my Design Thinking and Principles class, this project on rebranding
              the Natural History Museum allowed me to deeply engage with the process of creating a flexible brand
              identity.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Delivered:</strong> Through thorough brand research, I gained insights into the museum’s
              history, values, and the various elements that make it unique. This research informed my design decisions
              as I worked to retain the brand’s core essence while introducing dynamic, flexible elements in the logo.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> The process—from research and sketches to final digital renderings—was
              instrumental in teaching me how to maintain a brand’s legacy while embracing modern, creative
              possibilities. This project strengthened my understanding of how design can evolve without losing sight of
              its foundational identity, and it reinforced the importance of aligning design decisions with a brand’s
              story.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Scope:</strong> For my Design Thinking and Principles class, we followed the full design
              process from empathy to testing to create a solution that addresses a key problem for college students:
              the challenge of connecting overarching course concepts with relevant readings and assignments.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Delivered:</strong> Based on this insight, I developed a concept planner that organizes
              classes, assignments, and readings by overarching concepts, making it easier for students to connect their
              learning. The design process involved creating personas for busy college students with demanding majors,
              and I used those personas to guide the ideation and prototyping phases. User testing played a critical
              role in refining the solution.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> This project helped me understand how to translate research into a
              tangible design that addresses real user needs, with the final poster visually representing the problem,
              research findings, and the solution using typography and visual elements.</p>
